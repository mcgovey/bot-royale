# BattleBot Arena - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Purpose
Bot Royale is a **3D real-time combat game** where players design custom robots and battle in dynamic arenas. Built with React, Three.js, and TypeScript, it features beautiful 3D graphics, cyber-themed UI, and strategic gameplay.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
This is a **monorepo** with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend ([client/](mdc:client))
- **React 19** + **TypeScript** application
- **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber** for 3D graphics
- **Tailwind CSS** + custom cyber-themed styling
- Entry point: [client/src/index.tsx](mdc:client/src/index.tsx)
- Main app: [client/src/App.tsx](mdc:client/src/App.tsx)

### Backend ([server/](mdc:server))
- **Node.js** + **Express** + **TypeScript**
- **Socket.io** for real-time multiplayer
- Entry point: [server/src/index.ts](mdc:server/src/index.ts)

### Shared ([shared/](mdc:shared))
- Common **types** and **constants** used by both client and server
- Game logic and data structures

### Testing ([tests/](mdc:tests))
- Comprehensive **E2E testing** with Puppeteer
- **Performance**, **usability**, and **functionality** test suites
- Test runner: [tests/test-runner.js](mdc:tests/test-runner.js)

## 🎮 Game Modes
1. **Bot Builder Mode**: 3D interactive robot customization
2. **Battle Arena Mode**: 3D combat with player controls and AI opponents

## 🚀 Quick Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start both client and server in development
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production
